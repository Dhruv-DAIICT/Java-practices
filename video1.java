//why i have started with java
// so first reasone is that i am intresterd into web development and cp both
// second is i  m using diffrent platform and java is plateform independent

//jdk(development tools + (JRE (libreries + jvm) ))
// compilation
// source code (.java) -> compiler (jdk) -> Byte code (.class)  (and this system independent/ portable language)
// Execution -> conversion in native code (type of binary code)
// byte code -> JVM -> native code

//function
/*
 * void main(){ //void is return type return nothing 
 * }
 */


 //class  // can contain more than one function for ex. a kitchen contains many boxes
 /*
  * class Main(){
    void main(){

    }
  }
  */

  /*
   * comiled with javac filename.java and run with java filename
